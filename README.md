# A/B Testing

In this project I've received an analytical task (A/B test recieved from an international online store) that had been left in the middle by my predecessor who failed to complete it. (Only the technical specifications and the test results are available). My role was making sense of it and bringing it to completion.

The work done here is: 
   * Compare test description with the actual data and check whether the test was carried out correctly (which one of the two tests).
   * Analyze the results of the trustworthy test chosen and draw conclusions.
